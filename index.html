        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I'm someone who loves technology and is always looking to learn more. I have had many different jobs throughout the years. However, I would love to work with technology on a more day to day basis in my job.</p> 
        <p>I took a couple of coding courses in school and always thought it was very interesting. Hopefully, one-day coding could be more part of my daily life.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I would love to become a front-end web developer where I could work on a team or individual. Hopefully, I could work on different projects and learn new things while working on projects.</p>
        <p>Hopefully, one day I could also share my knowledge with someone else.</p>
